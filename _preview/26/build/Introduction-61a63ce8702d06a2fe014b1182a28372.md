## üåç Enhancing Algorithmic Literacy Among Vulnerable Populations through Geoscience Applications

Imagine a community-based geoscience project where local learners explore biodiversity through a dataset of penguin species.

In the geoscience community, algorithm literacy is more than technical fluency‚Äîit‚Äôs a pathway to justice. Vulnerable populations often bear the brunt of environmental decisions shaped by opaque data systems. To shift this paradigm, we must equip these communities not only with knowledge, but with agency.

ü§ñ Enter the AI teammate: not as a distant tool, but as a responsive partner! Through explicit AI prompts, learners can engage in targeted, conversational learning that breaks down complex algorithmic concepts into accessible, actionable insights. These prompts serve as microburst upskilling lessons‚Äîshort, focused interactions where AI explains concepts like correlations, classification, and feature importance in plain language.

Vulnerable populations, often excluded from technical discourse, now gain the tools to explore, question, and interpret data that mirrors real-world ecological systems‚Äîtailored to real-world geoscience challenges.

By embedding microburst upskilling into daily workflows and community initiatives, we create rapid, scalable opportunities for learning. These short, focused interactions with AI empower users to ask better questions, challenge assumptions, and co-create solutions. The result? A growing network of algorithm-literate individuals who can actively participate in‚Äîand shape‚Äîtheir own liberation.

Let us reimagine algorithm literacy not as a distant goal, but as a daily practice. With AI as a teammate and microburst learning as our method, we can build a geoscience future that is inclusive, transparent, and driven by the voices that matter most.
