Vulnerable populations often bear the brunt of environmental decisions shaped by opaque data systems. To shift this paradigm, we must equip these communities not only with knowledge, but with agency.\n\nEnter the AI teammate:  not as a distant tool, but as a responsive partner! Through explicit AI prompts, learners can engage in targeted, conversational learning that breaks down complex algorithmic concepts into accessible, actionable insights. These prompts serve as microburst upskilling lessons--short, focused interactions where AI explains cocepts like correlations, classification, and feature importance as plain language.\n\nVulnerable populations, often excluded from technical discourse, now gain the tools to explore, question, and interpret data that mirrors real-world ecological systems - tailored to real-world geoscience challenges.\n\nBy embedding microburst upskilling into daily workflows and community initiatives, we create rapid, scalable opportunities for learning. These short, focused interactions with AI empower users to ask better questions, challenge assumptions, and co-create solutions. The result? A growing network of algorithm-literate individuals who can actively participate in—and shape—their own liberation.\n\nLet us reimagine algorithm literacy not as a distant goal, but as a daily practice. With AI as a teammate and microburst learning as our method, we can build a geoscience future that is inclusive, transparent, and driven by the voices that matter most.","type":"content","url":"/#enhancing-algorithmic-literacy-among-vulnerable-populations-through-geoscience-applications","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"A Simplified Data Analysis Using an AI Teammate Exploration Cookbook","lvl2":"Authors"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/#authors","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"A Simplified Data Analysis Using an AI Teammate Exploration Cookbook","lvl2":"Authors"},"content":"First Author, \n\nSecond Author, etc. Acknowledge primary content authors here","type":"content","url":"/#authors","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"A Simplified Data Analysis Using an AI Teammate Exploration Cookbook","lvl3":"Contributors","lvl2":"Authors"},"type":"lvl3","url":"/#contributors","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"A Simplified Data Analysis Using an AI Teammate Exploration Cookbook","lvl3":"Contributors","lvl2":"Authors"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/#contributors","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"A Simplified Data Analysis Using an AI Teammate Exploration Cookbook","lvl2":"Structure"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/#structure","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"A Simplified Data Analysis Using an AI Teammate Exploration Cookbook","lvl2":"Structure"},"content":"(State one or more sections that will comprise the notebook.
