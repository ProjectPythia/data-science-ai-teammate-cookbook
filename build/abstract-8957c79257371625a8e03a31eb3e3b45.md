**Abstract**   

🌍 This *Project Pythia Cookbook* covers how **geoscience** enables algorithmic literacy through AI-guided microburst learning.  

In this application, learners gain core skills and confidence, earning badges toward data credentials.  

Most importantly, they reinvest by mentoring peers, co-creating local data solutions, and advocating for equitable systems—amplifying community voice and resilience through algorithmic fluency.
