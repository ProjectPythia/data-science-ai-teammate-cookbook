This Project Pythia Cookbook covers how geoscience enables algorithmic literacy through AI-guided microburst learning. In this application, learners gain core skills and confidence, earning badges toward data credentials. Most importantly, they reinvest by mentoring peers, co-creating local data solutions, and advocating for equitable systems—amplifying community voice and resilience through algorithmic fluency.

## 🌍 Enhancing Algorithmic Literacy Among Vulnerable Populations through Geoscience Applications

Imagine a community-based geoscience project where local learners explore biodiversity through a dataset of penguin species.

In the geoscience community, algorithm literacy is more than technical fluency—it’s a pathway to justice. Vulnerable populations often bear the brunt of environmental decisions shaped by opaque data systems. To shift this paradigm, we must equip these communities not only with knowledge, but with agency.

🤖 Enter the AI teammate: not as a distant tool, but as a responsive partner! Through explicit AI prompts, learners can engage in targeted, conversational learning that breaks down complex algorithmic concepts into accessible, actionable insights. These prompts serve as microburst upskilling lessons—short, focused interactions where AI explains concepts like correlations, classification, and feature importance in plain language.

Vulnerable populations, often excluded from technical discourse, now gain the tools to explore, question, and interpret data that mirrors real-world ecological systems—tailored to real-world geoscience challenges.

By embedding microburst upskilling into daily workflows and community initiatives, we create rapid, scalable opportunities for learning. These short, focused interactions with AI empower users to ask better questions, challenge assumptions, and co-create solutions. The result? A growing network of algorithm-literate individuals who can actively participate in—and shape—their own liberation.

Let us reimagine algorithm literacy not as a distant goal, but as a daily practice. With AI as a teammate and microburst learning as our method, we can build a geoscience future that is inclusive, transparent, and driven by the voices that matter most.

## 🧭 Structure

_(State one or more sections that will comprise the notebook. E.g., This cookbook is broken up into two main sections - "Foundations" and "Example Workflows." Then, describe each section below.)_

### 📚 Section 1 (Replace with the title of this section, e.g. "Foundations")

_(Add content for this section, e.g., "The foundational content includes ...")_

### 🛠️ Section 2 (Replace with the title of this section, e.g. "Example workflows")

_(Add content for this section, e.g., "Example workflows include ...")_

## 🧪 Running the Notebooks

You can either run the notebook using [Binder](https://binder.projectpythia.org/) or on your local machine.

### 🚀 Running on Binder

The simplest way to interact with a Jupyter Notebook is through [Binder](https://binder.projectpythia.org/), which enables the execution of a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) in the cloud. The details of how this works are not important for now. All you need to know is how to launch a Pythia Cookbooks chapter via Binder.

Simply navigate your mouse to the top right corner of the book chapter you are viewing and click on the 🚀 rocket ship icon, and be sure to select “launch Binder”. After a moment you should be presented with a notebook that you can interact with. You’ll be able to execute and even change the example programs. You’ll see that the code cells have no output at first, until you execute them by pressing `{kbd}Shift+Enter`.

📖 Complete details on how to interact with a live Jupyter notebook are described in [Getting Started with Jupyter](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-jupyter).

> ⚠️ Note: Not all Cookbook chapters are executable. If you do not see the rocket ship icon, such as on this page, you are not viewing an executable book chapter.

### 🖥️ Running on Your Own Machine

If you are interested in running this material locally on your computer, you will need to follow this workflow:

_(Replace "cookbook-example" with the title of your cookbooks)_

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ProjectPythia/cookbook-example.git

# 2. Move into the directory
cd cookbook-example

# 3. Create and activate your conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cookbook-example

# 4. Start JupyterLab
cd notebooks/
jupyter lab

digital literacy and data fluency empowering broader partication in the data-driven ecosystem.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates that data science is accessible and impactful across disciplines--from research and industry to government and community initiatives. By emphasizing hands-on experience, targeted prompts, and reproducible workflows, learners navigate their learning pathways through the attainment of task-specific badges that build toward meaningful data interpetation, problem solving, and critial thinking credentials. 

No prior coding is required to engage meaningfully with data science; and at its highest application learners gain and subsequently share core skills through open-sourced upskilling experiences that bridge the gap between technical barriers and real-world applications, empowering broader participation in the data-driven economy.  Crucially, learners re-invest by sharing the results of their skills development, co-creating local open-science solutions, and advocating for equity.  amplifying community voice and resilience through algorithmic fluency.

A key takeaway from our approach is that through AI-supported upskilling, learners can bridge the gap between technical barriers and real-world applications, empowering broader participation in the data-driven economy.  Most importantly,collective,open sourced content sharing can amplify community voice and resilience through algorithmic fluency.

Ultimately, this approach advocates for a democratized vision of data science—where anyone can learn, practice, and contribute—by fostering inclusive learning environments, sharing reproducible tools, and promoting AI-integrated pathways e.g. the AI Integration Specialist badge.
