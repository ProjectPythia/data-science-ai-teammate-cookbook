## üß™ Running the Notebooks

You can either run the notebook using [Binder](https://binder.projectpythia.org/) or on your local machine.

### üöÄ Running on Binder

The simplest way to interact with a Jupyter Notebook is through [Binder](https://binder.projectpythia.org/), which enables the execution of a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) in the cloud. The details of how this works are not important for now. All you need to know is how to launch a Pythia Cookbook chapter via Binder.

Simply navigate your mouse to the top right corner of the book chapter you are viewing and click on the üöÄ rocket ship icon, and be sure to select ‚Äúlaunch Binder‚Äù. After a moment you should be presented with a notebook that you can interact with. You‚Äôll be able to execute and even change the example programs. You‚Äôll see that the code cells have no output at first, until you execute them by pressing `{kbd}Shift+Enter`.

üìñ Complete details on how to interact with a live Jupyter notebook are described in [Getting Started with Jupyter](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-jupyter).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Not all Cookbook chapters are executable. If you do not see the rocket ship icon, such as on this page, you are not viewing an executable book chapter.
